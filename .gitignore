# Ignore all directories, and all sub-directories, and it's contents:
*/*

#Now ignore all files in the current directory 
#(This fails to ignore files without a ".", for example 
#'file.txt' works, but 
#'file' doesn't):
*.*

#Only Include these specific directories and subdirectories and files if you wish:
!.gitignore
!app/css
!app/css/dnd.css
!app/js
!app/js/dnd.js
!app/meta
!app/meta/dnd.json
!app/img
!app/img/gear.png
